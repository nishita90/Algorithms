/*
Suppose you have N integers from 1 to N.
We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these
N numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the ith
position (1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ N) in this array:

1) The number at the ith position is divisible by i.
2) i is divisible by the number at the ith position.
Now given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?
